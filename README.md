# FizzBuzz
Challenge: FizzBuzz

"Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz"."

"Fizz buzz (often spelled "FizzBuzz" in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability."

Since this is a second course in programming (prerequisite is either INFOTC 1040 or CMP_SC 1050), you should be able to write the FizzBuzz program in the programming language of your choice.

For this assignment:

Write a FizzBuzz program in the programming language of your choice.

The FizzBuzz program is to output numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with “Fizz”. If it is divisible by 5, replace it with “Buzz”. If it is divisible by 3 and 5 replace it with “FizzBuzz”.

The code and any project files are to be in a folder.  Submit a zip file of your project folder. 

Try the best you can to complete this task on your own.
